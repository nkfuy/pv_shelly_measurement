# pv_shelly_measurement

Little project to measure the power output provided by a hotovoltaic (pv) system and switches on additional consumers, in order to maximize the usage of pv created power. Overproduction of the pv system can therefore be used instead of feeding it into the public grid. Untill the pv system is installed, the power will be simulated by the regular power grid.
